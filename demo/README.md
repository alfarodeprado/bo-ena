# Demo data for ENflorA

This folder has everything you need to do a dry run of the full ENflorA
workflow using synthetic data. The idea is simple: run all three scripts with
`--demo`, check that nothing breaks, and then you know your setup (credentials,
Java, Webin-CLI, Python dependencies) is good to go for real data.

All sequence files here are random synthetic DNA. The ENA test server checks
that the format is valid but doesn't care about biological meaning, and it
automatically deletes test submissions the next day.


## Before you start

You'll need:

- Valid Webin credentials in `credentials.txt` at the repo root. The test
  server uses the same login as the live one.
- A **test study** created on the ENA test Webin Portal:
  https://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/

  Note the study accession you get (something like `PRJEB99999`).

Open `demo/DemoExperimentList.xlsx` and `demo/DemoAnalysisList.xlsx` and paste
the study accession into the STUDY column (cell A2 in the experiment sheet;
cells A2 and A3 in the analysis sheet, since it has two rows).


## Step-by-step walkthrough

The steps **must be run in this order**, because each one produces accession
IDs that the next step needs. This is the same as a real submission.

All commands below assume you start from the ENflorA root directory.

### Step 1 — Register demo biosamples

Open `demo/DemoBiosampleList.xlsx` and change the `isolate` field (cell A2) to
something unique — ENA rejects duplicate aliases even on the test server.
Appending today's date works fine (e.g. `ENflorA_demo_20260319`).

Then run:

```bash
cd biosamples
python biosamples.py --demo
cd ..
```

Or, if you're on the HPC, set `ena_object="biosamples"` and `demo="true"` in
`hpc.sh`, then run `sbatch hpc.sh` from the ENflorA root.

**Where to find the accession:** On successful submission, the script prints
the assigned SAMEA accession(s) directly to the terminal (or to the SLURM
`.out` file on HPC: `logs/ENflorA_<jobid>.out`). The accession is also saved
to `biosamples/demo_submission/biosample_accessions.txt`.

You'll need the SAMEA accession for the next two steps. Open
`demo/DemoExperimentList.xlsx` and `demo/DemoAnalysisList.xlsx` and paste it
into the SAMPLE column (cell B2 in the experiment sheet; cells B2 and B3 in
the analysis sheet).

### Step 2 — Submit demo reads

Make sure you've filled in STUDY (from step 0) and SAMPLE (from step 1) in
`demo/DemoExperimentList.xlsx`.

```bash
cd runs
python runs.py --demo
cd ..
```

Or HPC: set `ena_object="runs"` and `demo="true"` in `hpc.sh`, then
`sbatch hpc.sh`.

**Where to find the accession:** The script prints the assigned ERR (run) and ERX (experiment) accession(s) 
to the terminal as soon as they're returned by ENA. They are also saved to `runs/demo_submission/run_accessions.txt`. 
On HPC, both appear in `logs/ENflorA_<jobid>.out`.

Open `demo/DemoAnalysisList.xlsx` and paste the ERR accession into the
RUN_REF column (cells C2 and C3).

### Step 3 — Submit demo assemblies

This step needs accessions from **both** previous steps (SAMEA from step 1,
ERR from step 2), so make sure you've filled those in.

The demo analysis spreadsheet has two rows to test both supported file types:
row 1 submits an unannotated FASTA, row 2 submits an annotated EMBL flat file.

```bash
cd analysis
python analysis.py --demo
cd ..
```

Or HPC: set `ena_object="analysis"` and `demo="true"` in `hpc.sh`, then
`sbatch hpc.sh`.

**Where to find the accession:** same as step 2 — The script prints the assigned ERZ 
(analysis) accession(s) to the terminal. 
They are also saved to `analysis/demo_submission/analysis_accessions.txt`. 
On HPC, both appear in `logs/ENflorA_<jobid>.out`.

If all three steps complete without ENA errors, your setup works. You're
ready to plug in real data.


## Notes on the output

### Verbose `[demo]` lines

When you use `--demo`, the scripts print detailed trace lines prefixed with
`[demo]` showing what's happening at each step: which config file was loaded,
what the spreadsheet contains, how files are being staged and compressed, what
endpoint is being used, and so on. This can look like a lot of text, but
that's the point — it's there to help you see exactly where things go wrong
if they do. None of these lines appear during normal (non-demo) operation.

### Java warnings

When running `runs.py` or `analysis.py`, you may see warnings from Java like:

```
WARNING: A restricted method in java.lang.System has been called
WARNING: A terminally deprecated method in sun.misc.Unsafe has been called
```

**These are harmless.** They come from the Webin-CLI JAR interacting with
newer Java versions and do not affect the submission. As long as you see
"The submission has been completed successfully" above the warnings, everything
worked.

### Webin-CLI version notice

You may also see a notice like:

```
INFO : A new application version is available. Please download the latest version ...
```

This means a newer Webin-CLI JAR is available. You can download it from
https://github.com/enasequence/webin-cli/releases and replace the JAR file
in the ENflorA root. Update the `jar:` path in `config.yaml` and
`demo/config.yaml` if the filename changes.

## Spreadsheet details

**DemoBiosampleList.xlsx** — One sample, all mandatory fields for the ENA
plant checklist (ERC000037) pre-filled. The only thing you *must* change is
the `isolate` (cell A2) to avoid alias collisions.

The demo validates against `../biosamples/ERC000037.xml`, set by the
`checklist` key in `demo/config.yaml`. Point that key at any other ENA sample
checklist XML, with a table to match, to try a different one. `demo/config.yaml`
also carries the same `extra_mandatory`, `defaults` and `column_aliases` blocks
as the main config, because the demo table uses the same house column names as
`BiosampleList.xlsx` — if you copy this config as a starting point and drop
those blocks, your columns will stop matching.

**DemoExperimentList.xlsx** — One paired-end read row. Yellow-highlighted
cells (STUDY, SAMPLE) are placeholders that need real accessions. The FASTQ
paths already point to the bundled files.

**DemoAnalysisList.xlsx** — Two rows testing both analysis input types:

- Row 1 uses the FASTA file (unannotated contigs)
- Row 2 uses the EMBL flat file (annotated contigs)

Both rows reference the same STUDY, SAMPLE and RUN_REF accessions (yellow
placeholders). The script automatically handles the duplicate sample ID by
creating a `_2` suffix for the second row's submission folder.

The demo config sets `assembly_level: contig`, so no chromosome list file is
generated. Both the FASTA and EMBL files contain 2 sequences, which is the
minimum ENA requires for contig-level submissions.
